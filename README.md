# Evaluation of Neural Object Detection Models for Detecting Humans in Infrared Images

This repository contains the work on the topic "Evaluation of Neural Object Detection Models for Detecting Humans in Infrared Images" as part of the T1000 practical project at DHBW Ravensburg Campus Friedrichshafen.

The conditions and formal requirements for this work are described in the [project description](). The work is divided into two practical phases, each with two competencies

## Preliminary Topic of the Work:
For the purpose of video surveillance of company-owned grounds, a video surveillance system is to be developed. This system should be able to detect and report humans. Since the surveillance will take place outdoors, this work is limited to infrared images - the exact justification for this will follow in the work.  
Accordingly, the main component of this work is the evaluation of AI models and image preprocessing techniques for the detection of humans in infrared images, with the end goal to design an optimized model for this purpose.

## Practical Phase 1:

### Competence A: Evaluation of AI-supported Camera Surveillance
- Familiarization with the AI models YOLO and SSD
- Evaluation of the models for the specific use case
- Development of a concept for a test environment

### Competence B: Adapting a Suitable Model from RGB to Infrared Images
- Evaluation of image transformation measures
- Evaluation of model adjustments

## Practical Phase 2:

### Competence A: Evaluation of the Selected AI Models SSD300-ResNet152 and SSD300-VGG16
- Comparison of inference performance
- Comparison of model accuracy
- Suitability assessment of the two models based on comparison results

### Competence B: Development of an on-edge system for surveillance purposes using the selected models
- Collection of requirements, target environment, possible challenges or problems
- Selection and implementation of hardware
- Programming of the models
- Optimization of model quantization (performance to efficiency)

### Competence C: Safe transmission of detection results to a central system 
- Evaluation of various transmission paths
- Evaluation of secure protocols
- Theoretical design of a secure transmission path
