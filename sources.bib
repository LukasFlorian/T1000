  abstract = {The automatic detection of humans in aerial thermal imagery plays a significant role in various real-time applications, such as surveillance, search and rescue and border monitoring. Small target size, low resolution, occlusion, pose, and scale variations are the significant challenges in aerial thermal images that cause poor performance for various state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. Though many deep-learning-based object detection algorithms have shown impressive performance for generic object detection tasks, their ability to detect smaller objects in the aerial thermal images is analyzed through this study. This work carried out the performance evaluation of Faster R-CNN and single-shot multi-box detector (SSD) algorithms with different backbone networks to detect human targets in aerial view thermal images. For this purpose, two standard aerial thermal datasets having human objects of varying scale are considered with different backbone networks, such as ResNet50, Inception-v2, and MobileNet-v1. The evaluation results demonstrate that the Faster R-CNN model trained with the ResNet50 network architecture out-performed in terms of detection accuracy, with a mean average precision (mAP at 0.5 IoU) of 100\% and 55.7\% for the test data of the OSU thermal dataset and AAU PD T datasets, respectively. SSD with MobileNet-v1 achieved the highest detection speed of 44 frames per second (FPS) on the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. Fine-tuning the anchor parameters of the Faster R-CNN ResNet50 and SSD Inception-v2 algorithms caused remarkable improvement in mAP by 10\% and 3.5\%, respectively, for the challenging AAU PD T dataset. The experimental results demonstrated the application of Faster R-CNN and SSD algorithms for human detection in aerial view thermal images, and the impact of varying backbone network and anchor parameters on the performance improvement of these algorithms.},

  abstract = {Object detection in thermal infrared spectrum provides more reliable data source in low-lighting conditions and different weather conditions, as it is useful both in-cabin and outside for pedestrian, animal, and vehicular detection as well as for detecting street-signs \& lighting poles. This paper is about exploring and adapting state-of-the-art object detection and classifier framework on thermal vision with seven distinct classes for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The trained network variants on public datasets are validated on test data with three different test approaches which include test-time with no augmentation, test-time augmentation, and test-time with model ensembling. Additionally, the efficacy of trained networks is tested on locally gathered novel test-data captured with an uncooled LWIR prototype thermal camera in challenging weather and environmental scenarios. The performance analysis of trained models is investigated by computing precision, recall, and mean average precision scores (mAP). Furthermore, the trained model architecture is optimized using TensorRT inference accelerator and deployed on resource-constrained edge hardware Nvidia Jetson Nano to explicitly reduce the inference time on GPU as well as edge devices for further real-time onboard installations.},

  abstract = {Thermal cameras are popular in detection for their precision in surveillance in the dark and for privacy preservation. In the era of data driven problem solving approaches, manually finding and annotating a large amount of data is inefficient in terms of cost and effort. With the introduction of transfer learning, rather than having large datasets, a dataset covering all characteristics and aspects of the target place is more important. In this work, we studied a large thermal dataset recorded for 20 weeks and identified nine phenomena in it. Moreover, we investigated the impact of each phenomenon for model adaptation in transfer learning. Each phenomenon was investigated separately and in combination. the performance was analyzed by computing the F1 score, precision, recall, true negative rate, and false negative rate. Furthermore, to underline our investigation, the trained model with our dataset was further tested on publicly available datasets, and encouraging results were obtained. Finally, our dataset was also made publicly available.},

  abstract = {The sensibility and sensitivity of the environment play a decisive role in the safe and secure operation of autonomous vehicles. This perception of the surrounding is way similar to human visual representation. The human's brain perceives the environment by utilizing different sensory channels and develop a view-invariant representation model. Keeping in this context, different exteroceptive sensors are deployed on the autonomous vehicle for perceiving the environment. The most common exteroceptive sensors are camera, Lidar and radar for autonomous vehicle's perception. Despite being these sensors have illustrated their benefit in the visible spectrum domain yet in the adverse weather conditions, for instance, at night, they have limited operation capability, which may lead to fatal accidents. In this work, we explore thermal object detection to model a view-invariant model representation by employing the self-supervised contrastive learning approach. For this purpose, we have proposed a deep neural network Self Supervised Thermal Network (SSTN) for learning the feature embedding to maximize the information between visible and infrared spectrum domain by contrastive learning, and later employing these learned feature representation for the thermal object detection using multi-scale encoder-decoder transformer network. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on the two publicly available datasets: the FLIR-ADAS dataset and the KAIST Multi-Spectral dataset. The experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},
